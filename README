lintnode - a JSLint server for more expedient linting

I was setting up flymake-mode with jslint[1], and thinking it was
pretty great, but that rhino start-up cost is pretty big for a flymake
application.  If we just kept JSLint running, wouldn't that be a lot
faster?

Then I caught a talk on the node.js[2] server, and saw a way.

In my environment, this cuts jslint invocation time in half.

This project also depends on the Express framework[3].
